- Electrical Impedance tomography (EIT) is a non-invasive type of medical image used to infer electrical conductivity, dielectric constant, and impedance of parts of the body from surface electrode measurements and to form tomography.

- EIT has the advantages of non-permeable and high time resolution, but it has low spatial resolution and low sensitivity to electrode movement and contract quality.

- To overcome these disadvantages, we utillize GAN model to eliminate noise signals.
